A simple utility for setting backlight brightness on some
GNU/Linux systems using sysfs files.

This works like most system provided backlight brightness
controls but allows for increased resolution when the
brightness percentage nears zero.

* Usage

 =M-x backlight=
  Then use =<= or =>= to adjust backlight brightness, =C-g= when done.

 =M-x backlight-set-raw=
  prompts for a value to write directly to the device file.

* Setup

create file: =/etc/udev/rules.d/backlight.rules=
with contents:

: ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="backlight", KERNEL=="acpi_video0", GROUP="video", MODE="0664"

then run: =sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger=
